    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        
        <li>
            Brown the ground beef and Italian sausage in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
            Drain excess grease. Stir in the water and black olives, and season with basil,  <br />
            garlic powder, oregano, sage, pepper, minced garlic, and onion flakes. Simmer for 
            about 15 minutes, stirring frequently. Stir in the marinara sauce, and remove from the heat.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

        </li>
        
        <li>
            Place a layer of the meat and sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. 
            Cover with a layer of dry noodles. Spread a thin layer of ricotta cheese over  <br />
            the noodles, and sprinkle with a little mozzarella cheese. Cover with another 
            layer of sauce, and repeat layering ending with the meat and sauce on top. 
            Reserve about 1/2 cup of mozzarella cheese for later.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            Bake for 45 minutes in the preheated oven, but check after 30 minutes depending 
            on how thick the lasagna is. Lasagna is cooked when you can easily stick a knife  <br />
            into it. Sprinkle the reserved cheese over the top, and return to the oven for 
            about 10 minutes for a nice melted cheese topping.
        </li>
