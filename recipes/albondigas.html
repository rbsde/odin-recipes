    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <p>
        <li>
            Mix ground beef, ground pork, green onion, oregano, parsley, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, 
            salt, and black pepper together in a bowl. Slowly add and mix breadcrumbs into meat mixture <br />
            to desired consistency. Form mixture into balls, roll them in remaining bread crumbs to coat, 
            and arrange onto a shallow tray. Cover meatballs with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 30 minutes.
        </li>
        </p>
        <p>
        <li>
            Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir pancetta in the 
            hot oil until browned, about 4 minutes. Add onion and garlic to the pancetta; continue to cook and stir <br />
            until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir carrot, celery, and red bell pepper into the pancetta mixture; 
            cook until the carrot softens slightly, about 3 minutes. Sprinkle basil, oregano, coriander, <br />
            and black pepper over pancetta mixture; stir to season evenly.

        </li>
        </p>
        <p>
        <li>
            Pour wine over the pancetta mixture. Increase heat to medium-high and cook until the liquid reduces by about half.
        </li>
        </p>
        <p>
        <li>
            Quickly stir tomato puree into pancetta mixture; add chopped tomatoes. Cook and stir 
            the mixture until the tomatoes begin to break down into a sauce, about 5 minutes. <br />
            Reduce heat to low and simmer until the sauce thickens, 60 to 90 minutes.
        </li>
        </p>

        <p>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over low heat. Cook and stir meatballs in 
            batches in hot oil until evenly browned and cooked through, 5 to 7 minutes; drain on a plate <br />
            lined with paper towel.</li>
        </p>

         <p>   
        <li>Gently drop meatballs into the simmering sauce; cook together until meatballs are heated through, about 10 minutes.</li>
