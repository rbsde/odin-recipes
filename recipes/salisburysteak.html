    <h3>Who doesn't love Salisbury Steak!</h3>
    <p style="font-size: 1.2em;">
        

        I was tired of boring, tasteless Salisbury steak recipes, so I created this one myself. 
        Use good ground sirloin, and it'll tastes wonderful and you won't have any grease to drain from the <br />
        patties once they've browned. 
        Serve over mashed potatoes, egg noodles, or rice. Simply delightful! 

    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>For the Patties:

        <ul>
            <li>

                1 pound ground sirloin</li>
                <li>½ cup panko bread crumbs</li>
                <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons milk</li>
                <li>½ (1 ounce) package dry onion soup mix</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper 
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>For the Gravy:

    <ul>  
        <li>3 tablespoons butter</li> 
        <li>2 cups fresh mushrooms, sliced</li> 
        <li>1 sweet onion, sliced</li> 
        <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li> 
        <li>½ (1 ounce) package dry onion soup mix</li> 
        <li>1 ½ cups beef stock</li> 
        <li>1 cup water</li> 
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li> 
         </ul>

    </p>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <p>
        <li>
            Mix ground sirloin, panko bread crumbs, egg, milk, and 1/2 packet onion soup mix, Worcestershire sauce, 
            and black pepper together in a large bowl; shape into 5 patties.

        </li>
        </p>
        <p>
        <li>
            Heat a skillet over medium heat. Cook patties in hot skillet until browned, 3 to 5 minutes per side.

        </li>
        </p>
        <p>
        <li>
            Melt butter in a separate skillet over medium-high heat. Saute mushrooms and onion in melted 
            butter until tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir flour and remaining dry onion soup mix into the mushroom <br />
            mixture; cook and stir until flour is integrated fully, about 1 minute. Stream beef stock and water 
            over the mushroom mixture while stirring continually; bring to a simmer, reduce heat to medium, and <br />
            cook, stirring frequently, until the liquid thickens, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
        </li>
        </p>
        <p>
        <li>
            Lie the browned steaks into the gravy; simmer until steaks are firm and gray in the center, 
            about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F 
            (70 degrees C)..
